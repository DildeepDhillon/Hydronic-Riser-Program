# Hydronic-Riser-Program
Hydronic Riser Program for automatic riser sizing for HVAC equipment

## About the program:
Used Python and the Pandas library to extract information for an Excel workbook, then this information was stored and organized into vectors that contained objects (objects are created from the information we extracted). These objects are then updated with new values for the size of the piping, and flow coming in for each riser and each floor, which is calculated based on which level the supply flow comes in. The goal of the program is to take the information from the Excel workbook and a few inputs from the user to generate an Excel workbook that lists the pipe size, and flow (in gpm) for each floor and each riser. Which improves workflow for engineering sales organizations, automating tedious multi-hour tasks and eliminating human error.
